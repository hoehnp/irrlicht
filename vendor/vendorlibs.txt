Libraries used inside Irrlicht and distributed with it.
There are sometimes a few files removed (large files we don't need and build files we don't use).
Inside Irrlicht the libs can have further changes, so when updating do a diff first between vendor libs and the corresponding libs in trunk.

Note: In svn it will be easier to update the library sub-folders instead of removing them and adding them with new version. That will result in conflicts when trying to merge branchnes.

-----
bzip2 
-----
version 1.0.6 from package bzip2-10.0.6.tar.gz
rm sample*
rm manual.*

Inside Irrlicht:
compress.c got renamed to bzcompress.c (not sure why, maybe some conflict with compress.c from zlib if some project writes .o files for subprojects into the same subfolder)
Also a few minor changes in bzlib.c and bzlib.h (probably to get it compiling on VS)

-----
lzma
-----
There is no vendorlib for lzma, not sure if that is accidental or not done because it's just one .c file and two headers.

-------
gladman
-------
enfile.zip from Gladman's site (http://173.254.28.24/~brgladma//oldsite/cryptography_technology/fileencrypt/index.php), removed the bzip stuff and renamed c files to cpp.
Note there is a newer version of most files on https://github.com/BrianGladman/AES. Including a newer license (similar to old but shorter).
But in Irrlicht we only care about unzipping password protected files, as long as that works and it compiles we are fine.

# remove files we don't need
rm *.vcproj
rm encfile.*
rm bzlib.h
rm -rf bzip2
rm main.c
# Rename c files to cpp (because we will use Irrlicht types later on)
for f in *.c; do mv -- "$f" "${f%.c}.cpp"; done

Inside Irrlicht:
There are a lot of minor changes. Most to get it compiling together with Irrlicht on all kind of platforms.

-------
jpeglib
-------
version 9a from package jpegsrc.v9a.tar.gz
Has 2 additional files readme.dos and jdosaobj.txt which are only found in jpegsr9a.zip, but that is otherwise more different than the .tar.gz (maybe just around from an older version)

Inside Irrlicht:
Additional file jconfig.h (maybe generated somehow, seems to be a autoconfiguration header)

------
libpng
------
version 1.6.37 from package lpng1637.zip or pgng1623.7z (the xz or tar.gz archives were different in past, not sure if still the case)

Inside Irrlicht:
The sub-folders are not copied to source/Irrlicht/libpng only the main-folder.

copy scripts/pnglibconf.h.prebuilt to pnglibconf.h

Can remove config*, autogen, ltmain.sh and similar build files files (configure became rather large recently and it's not the way to build this in Irrlicht).
Note that those files are still in vendor folder when needed. 
Do keep documentation and license intact!

----
zlib
----
version 1.2.8
rm -R -- */
rm *.com

Inside Irrlicht:
unchanged :-)
