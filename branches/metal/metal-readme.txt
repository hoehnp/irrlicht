This branch is used for development of the Apple Metal drivers for Irrlicht.
There will be a driver for Metal 2.x, but we'll start
with 2.x first and add support for the outdated version later maybe. Both drivers will be separate drivers, loosely based on the Apple Metal driver.
The branch is based on SVN/trunk and will be updated only very slowly. It's
not intended for regular use besides when working with metal development.
